### Art Piece 1

The new media art piece titled “Text Rain”, was created by Camille Utterback and was most recently exhibited at the Smithsonian Institute in Washington, DC. I was instantly drawn to this piece by the nature of the interactivity of the installation. Participants are invited to come up to the raining letters and move in front of it, causing the letters to scatter in coordination with their motion. What I found striking about this piece was how the artwork is subjected to the individual’s actions, and is forced to respond to their autonomous action. The falling letters can be caught and discarded, lifted and dropped by the viewers. Not only are the participants involved in the disruption of falling letters, they simultaneously participate in manipulating a poem as the letters make up the lines of a poem about body and language.
